# Mouse Ethogram

## Maintenance

### Grooming

Usually in a sitting position, the mouse will lick its fur, groom with the forepaws, or scratch with any limb. Often the mouse will mix all of these grooming behaviors.

### Drinking

The animal rears up and licks the nozzle of the drinker

### Feeding

The animal rears up to gnaw at food pellets through the bars of the food hopper. The forepaws are generally used to hold the food pellet steady.

## Exploratory Behavior

### Search

Search involves all locomotive behavior, that is not otherwise defined (e.g.  fleeing or approach). Search may be interrupted by brief bouts of attend or investigate behaviors.

### Attend

The mouse, from a short distance away, will direct its attention towards a stimulus, indicated by pause in locomotion, and a fixation of the eyes and ears on the stimulus.

### Approach

The mouse locomotes towards a stimulus. 

### Investigate Sniffing

The mouse makes rapid twitching movements of the nose, either with the nose in contact with the stimulus, or held in an elevated position in the air.

### Investigate  Whisking

With the whiskers in contact with the stimulus, the mouse rapidly brushes the whiskers along the surface and edges of the stimulus.

## Affiliative Interactions

### Group Sleeping

Sleeping that occurs with two or more mice.

### Allo-grooming

Grooming that occurs between two or more mice.

## Agonistic Interactions

### Threat

Mounting or Thrust: actions where one mouse challenges another, often to assert dominance. Mounting in this context is a non-sexual dominance display, while thrusting is a quick, direct aggressive approach. These behaviors can escalate to a fight if the threatened mouse doesn't submit.

### Submissive

Submissive upright is a posture where the animal, will sit in an upright position with its head in the air, while stretching out its forepaws, exposing the belly.

### Aggressive Fighting

A violent behavior displayed by each animal when locked together. Separate behaviors are difficult to distinguish properly due to the fast rolling over and over seen with the animals kicking, biting, and wrestling.

### Aggressive Bite

This behavior usually directly follows an attack movement. It is regarded as a social act when the teeth grip the skin, and the head is pulled back sharply. Typically the bite causes no damage to the recipient and is often directed toward the tail or rump of the recipient.

### Fleeing & Chase

A mouse will chase a fleeing partner, however no biting occurs.

### Defensive: Crouch

This behavior is defined as the animal lying still in a rigid position with its ears down and its eyes closed or nearly closed.

## Abnormal Behaviors

### Circling

A circling mouse repetitively traces a loosely circular path (usually on the cage top). While circling, the mouse may change its body orientation, alter its direction, and intermix other behaviors while following the path. 

### Jumping

Single jumps are a perfectly normal behavior. To classify this behavior as a stereotypy, there will be an intense cluster of jumps (more than 20 per minute) or the mouse will do a smaller number of jumps but in multiple consecutive sessions.
